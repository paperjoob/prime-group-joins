-- ##Exercise
-- For each of the following questions

-- Write a comment that specifies which question you are answering. (SQL comments are two dashes, followed by text.)
-- Write the SQL query that answers the question, below that comment.
-- Once one person writes half of the queries, switch off.

-- ##Tasks
-- Get all customers and their addresses.
-- Get all orders and their line items (orders, quantity and product).
-- Which warehouses have cheetos?
-- Which warehouses have diet pepsi?
-- Get the number of orders for each customer. NOTE: It is OK if those without orders are not included in results.
-- How many customers do we have?
-- How many products do we carry?
-- What is the total available on-hand quantity of diet pepsi?

-- ##Stretch
-- How much was the total cost for each order?
-- How much has each customer spent in total?
-- How much has each customer spent in total? Customers who have spent $0 should still show up in the table. It should say 0, not NULL (research coalesce).
